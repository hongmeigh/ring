		China is expected to see its power shortages substantially eased beginning in the next half of this year, according to a senior official with the China Electricity Council (CEC) yesterday.

"Power supply and demand will be balanced nationwide in the next of the year, although short-term power shortages will still exist in a few regions," said CEC secretary-general Wang Yonggan.

Power shortages only existed in four provinces in June, compared with 25 at the beginning of 2005 and nine in January.

Wang said power shortages had been remarkably relieved in the first six months of this year because more newly built large power stations were put into use.

In the first half of this year, China saw a newly installed power capacity of 32.41 million kilowatts, 11.1 percent of which is from hydro power stations and 88.48 percent from thermal power plants.
